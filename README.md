# Analysing the Concept Quality of a CBM

This repository contains a modified version of a code proposed by Koh et al. 2020.

The goal here is to understand weather the model learns good concepts.

To have a rapid notion of the results look at "Concept Evaluation.pdf".

To start my experiment just download "Implemented_Koh" and follow its README.md. CUB dataset is required: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenewone/cub2002011
